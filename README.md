# PHY617/473_Computational_Physics using Python
This course is designed to introduce the details of numerical computation used in various fields of physics. 
Students have been introduced to techniques to solve physics-based problems using numerical computation.
All the assignments and solutions are uploaded for free to use. Incase of any queries, feel free to drop
me an email. My email address is hazra@iitk.ac.in. Happy learning. 

Go to the folder "Computational_physics_PHY617_Gopal_Hazra_IITKanpur" to find 12 assignments encompassing all the 
topics in computational physics, starting from basic Python, root findings, interpolation, integration, differentiation,
ODE, second-order ODE, matrix algebra, and basic PDEs. Solutions of all assignments are given in the Jupyter notebook format. 

Note: In case the PDF copy of the assignments shows a rendering error, just download them.
